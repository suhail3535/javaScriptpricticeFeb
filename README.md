localStorage.setItem() and sessionStorage.setItem() are both methods provided by the Web Storage API in JavaScript, which allows web applications to store data locally within the user's browser.

localStorage.setItem(key, value):

This method sets the value of the specified key in the localStorage object. The data persists even after the browser is closed and reopened, as long as it's not explicitly removed.
key: A string representing the name of the key you want to create/update.
value: A string representing the value you want to store.
Example usage:

localStorage.setItem('username', 'John');
sessionStorage.setItem(key, value):

Similar to localStorage.setItem(), but the data stored using sessionStorage is available only for the duration of the page session. Once the browser tab is closed, the data is cleared.
key: A string representing the name of the key you want to create/update.
value: A string representing the value you want to store.

Example usage:
sessionStorage.setItem('username', 'John');

Both methods follow the same syntax and are widely supported across modern web browsers. They provide a simple and convenient way to store small amounts of data locally within the browser, which can be useful for things like user preferences, authentication tokens, or caching data for improved performance. However, it's important to remember that Web Storage is limited to storing data in the form of strings, so you may need to serialize and deserialize more complex data structures if you want to store them using these methods.

Why We  JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse

We stringify and parse data when working with localStorage or sessionStorage because these storage mechanisms can only store data in the form of strings. When you store data using setItem(), it converts any non-string values into strings automatically. However, if you want to store more complex data types like arrays or objects, you need to convert them to strings explicitly using JSON.stringify() before storing them. Similarly, when retrieving data from localStorage or sessionStorage, you need to convert the stored string back into its original data type using JSON.parse().

Here's why and how we do it:

Storing Complex Data Types:
const userData = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(userData));
In this example, we stringify the userData object using JSON.stringify() before storing it in localStorage.

Retrieving Data:
const storedUserData = localStorage.getItem('user');
const parsedUserData = JSON.parse(storedUserData);
console.log(parsedUserData.name); // Outputs: John
Here, we retrieve the stringified data from localStorage using getItem(), and then parse it back into its original object form using JSON.parse().

Updating Data:
If you want to update a stored object, you'll typically retrieve it, modify it, stringify it again, and then store it back:
Example:-
const storedUserData = localStorage.getItem('user');
const parsedUserData = JSON.parse(storedUserData);
parsedUserData.age = 31;
localStorage.setItem('user', JSON.stringify(parsedUserData));




By using JSON.stringify() before storing data and JSON.parse() after retrieving it, you can work with complex data types in localStorage and sessionStorage while adhering to their requirement of storing data as strings.
